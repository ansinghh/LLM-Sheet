# LLM-Sheet: Talk to Your Data with Natural Language

**LLM-Sheet** is a command-line tool that lets you upload CSVs and query your data using everyday language — powered by GPT-4 and SQLite.

No need to remember SQL syntax. Just ask:

> “Give me all the customers from Boston.”  
> “Add a product called ‘Flux Capacitor’ priced at $299.”  
> “Which employee joined after 2022?”
